## 2021-11-25 Externalize services declarations

Services declarations are now declared in their [own repository](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-declarations).

In order to use all the defined services locally, you now have to clone that new repository in the parent folder of the OpenTermsArchive one:

```
    # From your local clone of the OpenTermsArchive repository
    cd ..
    git clone git@github.com:OpenTermsArchive/contrib-declarations.git
```

## 2021-02-24 Name change

`CGUs` is now called `OpenTermsArchive`.

To reflect this change, if you already have this project locally, execute:

```
    # From your local clone of the OpenTermsArchive repository
    cd ..
    mv CGUs OpenTermsArchive
    cd OpenTermsArchive
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive.git
```
