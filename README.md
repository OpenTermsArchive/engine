> Suit et rend visibles les modifications des Conditions Générales d'Utilisations des principaux fournisseurs de services en ligne.

## Installing

This module is built with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). You will need to [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run it.

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ambanum/CGUs.git
cd CGUs
npm install
```

## Usage

To get the latest versions of all service providers' terms:

```
npm start
```

The latest version will be available in `/data/sanitized/$service_provider_name/$document_type.md`.

To hourly update documents:

```
npm run start:scheduler
```

## Adding a service provider

In the folder `providers`, create a JSON file with the name of the service provider you want to add, with the following structure:

```json
{
  "serviceProviderName": "<the public name of the service provider>",
  "documents": {
    "<document type>": {
      "url": "<the URL where the document can be found>",
      "contentSelector": "<a CSS selector that targets the meaningful part of the document, excluding elements such as headers, footers and navigation>",
    }
  }
}
```

For the `<document type>` key, you will have to use one of those listed in `/src/documents_types.js` (or create a new one there if it is not already referenced).
You can find examples in the `providers` folder.
