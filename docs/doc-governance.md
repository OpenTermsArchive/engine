# Governance

## Instances

### Creating an instance

Each **instance** has an **administrator** who takes responsibility for ensuring that the **engine** is up to date and works properly, and **maintainers** who take responsibility for ensuring the quality of the resulting **versions**.

All of these roles can be either volunteer or funded by **sponsors**. Anyone is free to create their own **collection** using their own **instance**.

### Referencing an instance

A **collection** can be **referenced** in the Open Terms Archive **federation** if it abides by the following quality criteria:

1. Clearly defined **scope**.
2. Clearly defined **maintainer**.
3. Clearly defined **administrator**.
4. The vast majority of **versions** are readable.
5. **Frequency** of at least one track a day.
6. Public and open-licensed **snapshots**.
7. Public and open-licensed **versions**.
8. Regular, public, and open-licensed **dataset** releases.
