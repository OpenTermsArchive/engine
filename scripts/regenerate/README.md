This script recreates a history of versions from existing snapshots and declarations, based on the current configuration.

To override the configuration, use a `NODE_ENV` variable with the name of the configuration file you want to load.

Warning: this will irreversibly erase all of your versions repository contents. Make sure to back it up.

Usage:

```sh
node index.js
```
