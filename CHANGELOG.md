_Full changeset and discussions: [#996](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/pull/996), [#999](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/pull/999)._

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Rename CLI option `--terms-types` to `--types` in API; simply rename accordingly in your own codebase
- **Breaking:** Rename CLI option `--refilter-only`, `-r` to `--extract-only`, `-e` in API; simply rename accordingly in your own codebase
- **Breaking:** Rename class `PageDeclaration` to `SourceDocument` and its atribute `noiseSelectors` to `insignificantContentSelectors` in API; simply rename accordingly in your own codebase
- **Breaking:** Rename function and its parameters `filter({ content, mimeType, pageDeclaration })` to `extract(sourceDocument)` in API; `content` and `mimeType` are embedded `sourceDocument` attributes; rename accordingly in your own codebase and set `content` and `mimeType` in the `sourceDocument` passed as a parameter to the function
- **Breaking:** Rephrase commit messages in Git storage: `Start tracking` is changed to `First record of`, `Refilter` to `Apply technical or declaration upgrade on` and `Update` to `Record new changes of`; existing data will still be loaded, but new commits will use these new messages, if you have scripts that parse commit messages directly, update them accordingly
- **Breaking:** Rename document attribute `isRefilter` to `isExtractOnly` in MongoDB storage; existing data will still be loaded, but new entries will use this new attribute, if you have scripts that query the Mongo database directly, update them accordingly
- Make vocabulary consistent throughout the codebase ([#971](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/pull/971))
