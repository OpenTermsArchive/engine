# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and the format is based on [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org). 
Unlike Common Changelog, the `unreleased` section of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) is preserved with the addition of a tag to specify which type of version should be released and to foster discussions about it inside pull requests. This tag should be one of the following: `[patch]`, `[minor]`, `[major]`. Ex `Unreleased [minor]`.
