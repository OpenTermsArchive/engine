# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and the format is based on [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org), with the following variations:
- Keep `[Unreleased]` section as discussion point inside PRs but with the idea that CD will always convert it into a release.
- Add a tag in the unreleased section title to specify which type of version should be deployed and to allow discussion about this type inside PRs. This tag should be one of `[patch]`, `[minor]`, `[major]`. Ex: `## [Unreleased][minor]`

## [Unreleased][minor]
